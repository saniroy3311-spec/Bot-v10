# Shiva Sniper v6.5 — Python Trading Bot
**High-performance intraday & swing trading bot for Delta Exchange India.**

Shiva Sniper v6.5 is a production-grade trading bot designed to replicate **Pine Script** strategies with 99.9% accuracy. It features a multi-stage trailing stop engine, real-time indicator synchronization, and a built-in web dashboard for performance monitoring.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **TV Accuracy Engine**: Uses `pandas-ta` to mirror TradingView’s `ta.ema`, `ta.atr`, and `ta.rsi` calculations exactly.
* **5-Stage Trail Ratchet**: Dynamic SL management based on ATR multiples to lock in profits as the trade progresses.
* **Dual Regime Detection**: Automatically switches logic between **Trend** (ADX > 22) and **Range** (ADX < 18) markets.
* **Persistence & Recovery**: Powered by a unified journal system (PostgreSQL/SQLite) that survives bot redeploys and server restarts.
* **Real-time Dashboard**: Aiohttp-powered web interface with live P/L charts, trade history, and bot status.
